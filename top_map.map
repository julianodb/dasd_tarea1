WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, VLSI_HDMI_MEM_CURSO/HDMI_AND_MEMORY_CLOCK_MANAGER/dcm_clkgen_inst, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not
   set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths
   between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net btn_pushed is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
